# random-episode-generator
Script for picking a random TV show episode.
The script uses BeautifulSoup to scrape data from IMDb and presents an episode title and description.
While the script is based on an idea of suggesting random episodes of the show It's Always Sunny in Philladelphia it can be tweaked for any show on IMDb. In the future I would like to add a front-end UI.
